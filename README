this is the code for the Myspace wrapper service at
	http://dbtune.org/myspace

4Store is used for storing info in a SPARQL endpoint
MoPy is used to create the RDF
BeautifulSoup is used in the page scraping
probably some other dependencies i'm forgetting

if for some reason you actually want to run this software yourself, contact
kurtjx at gmail
