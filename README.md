this is the code for the DBTune MySpace Wrapper Service at
	http://dbtune.org/myspace

* 4Store is used for storing info in a SPARQL endpoint
* MoPy is used to create the RDF
* BeautifulSoup is used in the page scraping
* probably some other dependencies i'm forgetting

if for some reason you actually want to run this software yourself, contact
